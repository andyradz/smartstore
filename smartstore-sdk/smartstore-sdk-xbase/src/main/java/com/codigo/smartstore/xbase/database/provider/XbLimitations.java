	// dBase IV limitations
	//

	// Approach can use a number of different database file structures, but uses
	// dBaseIV by default. dBaseIV has the
	// following limitations that you might need to be aware of:
	//
	// maximum file size = 2 gigabytes (per type .dbf or .dbt file)
	// maximum records per database = 1,000,000,000 (1 billion)
	// maximum of 30 open dBaseIV databases on a single computer
	// maximum number of fields per record = 255
	// maximum size of a record = 4000 characters (= all the field-lengths added
	// together)
	// - Text field size equals the size defined in characters
	// - Date field uses 8 characters stored as text YYYYMMDD
	// - Time field uses 8 characters stored as text HHMMSSHH
	// - Boolean field uses 1 character (T, F or blank is stored)
	// - Memo or PicturePlus field uses 10 characters stored as a "record number" in
	// the .DBT file
	// - Numeric field uses characters equal to the size definition plus 1. (Numeric
	// 10.2 stores in 13 characters, 5.3
	// stores in 9 characters.
	//
	// maximum length of a text field = 254 characters
	// maximum number of characters in a dBaseIV memo field is 30,000 characters in
	// releases prior to V9.8, which was
	// fixed in that release to allow up to 65,536 (64KB).
	// Some common error messages when using dBaseIV files:
	// -1003 when adding a field makes the record too long
	// -1035 when the .DBT file has reached the 2 gigabyte limit and no more records
	// can be added
	// Information about field names:
	// Approach Field Definition allows up to 32 characters for field names, and it
	// allows alphabetic letters, whole
	// numbers, spaces, commas, periods, and arithmetic signs. If you delete the
	// SmartIndex file (.ADX):
	// Your field names are truncated to the dBaseIV standard of 10 characters, all
	// capitals, with no blanks or special
	// characters other than the underscore.
	// Non-allowed characters and blanks will be replaced with the underscore.
	// A "Time" field name will always end with the characters "TM9" so that
	// Approach will know it is a time field.
	// PicturePlus field names always end with the characters "PC9" so that Approach
	// will know it is a PicturePlus
	// field.
	// dBaseIV Field names must be unique, so if you have field names that are the
	// same in the first 10 characters, you
	// will see a series of similar field names which may be difficult to work with.
	// For example, "Customer Name",
	// "Customer Number", "Customer Notice" will become "CUSTOMER_N", "CUSTOMER_2"
	// and "CUSTOMER_3".
	// Information about sharing dBaseIV files:
	// Approach does not create or maintain the native dBaseIV index file for a
	// database. This is important if you plan
	// to also use the database in an application that depends on the presence of
	// this index. Approach PicturePlus
	// fields cannot be viewed in other dBASE application
